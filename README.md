This Git repository is an analysis pipeline for identifying Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with complex traits in genetic data. It supports analysis of multiple sequencing modes, including Paired-End (PE), Single-End (SE), and Single Primer Enrichment Technology (SPET) with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) sequencing.

Please refer to the [documentation](../../wikis) for instructions on how to use this code.
